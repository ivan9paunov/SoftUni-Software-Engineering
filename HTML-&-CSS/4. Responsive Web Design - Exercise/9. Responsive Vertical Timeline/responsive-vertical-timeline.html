                            browser): HTML: HyperText Markup Language. The
                            markup (formatting) language for the web. URI:
                            Uniform Resource Identifier. A kind of “address”
                            that is unique and used to identify to each resource
                            on the web. It is also commonly called a URL. HTTP:
                            Hypertext Transfer Protocol. Allows for the
                            retrieval of linked resources from across the web.</p>
